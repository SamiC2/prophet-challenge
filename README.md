## Columbia AI Bootcamp Week 8 Module Assignment  
### By Sami Chowdhury  

This was a simple assignment analyzing time series data to find trends and either support or deny narratives proposed using correlations between lagged data, percent changes in stock closing prices, and search trend data. I was also able to succesfully use Prophet to predict future trends in the search trends data to determine what the data was forecasting in the future. I was also able to drill into the data by month, year, day, and hour of day.  

Using this week's assignments helped in solving what was needed for the assignment.
